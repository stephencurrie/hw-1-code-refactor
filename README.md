# Homework Assignment Week1 - Code Refactoring

## Description

The purpose of this exercise was to gain skill in refactoring existing code.  In this case, it was specifically to make the code more semantic.  

We were given a screenshot of an existing website with files for the HTML and CSS.  The goal was to refactor the code of both the HTML and CSS while maintaining the existing look and functionality of the site.

The work was assigned via a ticket.  There were several acceptance criteria for the completion of the code refactoring.

We then uploaded all of our files to GitHub and published our website in GitHub pages with our refactored code.

## Problem

There are many advantages to have your code semantic.  Some of the benefits include:
- Code is easier to read by screen readers for the visually impaired.
- Search engines can more easily determine what your site is about.  This can improve your placement in search results.
- Semantic code can be easier to update and can load faster.
